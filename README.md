This is a simple Python script that allows users to encrypt and decrypt images using XOR encryption. The tool provides a command-line interface for users to specify the image file path, encryption/decryption key, and perform the desired operation.

## Features

- Encrypt images using XOR encryption with a user-defined key.
- Decrypt previously encrypted images using the same key.
- Simple command-line interface for ease of use.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `encryption_decryption_tool.py` script.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Run the script using the following command:
   ```bash
   python encryption_decryption_tool.py
